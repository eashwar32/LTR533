#Check compatibility for MONO use .NET portability analyzer

#Build and run VS project using Mono in RPI


#Rasp config for mono:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
    mono --version
    compile CS : mcs "filename"
	run CS or exe : mono "filename"

#fix:

#Image size
#windows & Linux competability

#PICKitS dll modification to support linux

1.Do reverse engineer Pickits.dll from Microchip using ILSpy Portable
2. Referred github pickits source to fix compilation bug

Note: path slash likely need to change in Pickits source for linux

#Look for HID dll alternate for linux

1. Download HIDAPI cross platform HID library
2. download HIDAPI_interfcace for C# 
3. test HIDAPI_interface with liteon device

Done:

#windows
1. Reverse Engineered and Got source code of Pickits.dll using ILSpy Portabale software
2. Integrated HIDAPI_Interface  with PICKitS driver
3. Modified HIDAPI_Interface to support PICKITs
4. Modified HIDAPI C source to support PICKITs
5. Removed Windows dependencey DLLs from Pickits
6. Tested on Windowss

#linux
1.Built application project using mono
2.Built hidapi.so library from source - used libhidapi-hidraw
3.Change libhidapi-hidraw.so to hidapi.so in Makefile-manual
4.compile makefile-manual using "make -f Makefile-manual" command
5.Copy hidapi.so file to /lib directory
6.Update Mono config file for DLL map
     sudo emacs /etc/mono/config
	 <dllmap dll="hidapi" target="hidapi.so" os="!windows"/>
7.No need to set UDEV rule 	 
8.Build PICKitS-HIDAPI_Interface Project in mono

Note: 
   Modification required in PICKitS-HIDAPI_Interface project to build on mono were as follows:
       1.Changed .NET standard to .NET framwork 4.6
	   2.Changed ToolChain version to 15.0 - 12.0
	   3.Changed Language version from 7.3 to Default

8.Comm error Fixed:
     Windows Report dscriptor size is 65 bytes.
     Linux Report dscriptor size is 64 bytes.
     
     Can send 65 bytes through both platform.
     But Linux can read 64 bytes from HID. So 0x00 must be prepend in read data before pass it to PickitS data processing.

9.Fix hid read issue
      Added 10ms thread sleep in PICKitS read thread to avoid hid read overhead. 
	   
10. Device communcation was tested.

11.Fix BitMAP issue
     Image path and its extension was wrong. JPG and jpg were different.

12. Created Git repository and uploaded linux version

13. Fix CIE chart issue
       *remove iterative Invalidate() func from paint event handler.
       * call invalidate from Run_Click() func.
	   
14. Fixed Hid Timeout issue in RPi.
	*hidapi.so returned -1 on timeout which was not handled in PICKitS-USBinterface project.
	* Returned null on neagtive read and added handler on null return
15. Setup root user access for application
      Wrote Shell script to run application as root and made shell script as executable
	  
16.Changed GetCurrentDirectory to Path.GetDirectoryName(Application.ExecutablePath); to solve relative path error.

#Todo:


*seggregate Windows and linux issues based on OS type.
*Compile on different platform and test
*Control GUI maximum size based on monitor resolution
*Summarise changes required in an application to support both windows and linux platform
*Deploy
*end of porject
